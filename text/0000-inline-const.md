# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Adds a new syntactical element called an "inline `const`", written as
`const { ... }`, which instructs the compiler to execute the contents of the
block at compile-time. An inline `const` can be used as an expression or
anywhere in a pattern where a named `const` would be allowed.

```rust
use std::net::Ipv6Addr;

fn mock_ip(use_localhost: bool) -> &'static Ipv6Addr {
    if use_localhost {
        &Ipv6Addr::LOCALHOST
    } else {
        const { &Ipv6Addr::new(0x2001, 0xdb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) }
    }
}

fn main() {
    match *x {
        0 ..= const { u32::MAX / 2 } => println!("low"),
        const { u32::MAX / 2 + 1 } ..= u32::MAX => println!("high"),
    }
}
```

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Rust has `const` items, which are guaranteed to be initialized at compile-time.
Because of this, they can do things that normal variables cannot.  For example,
a reference in a `const` initializer has the `'static` lifetime, and a `const`
can be used as an array initializer even if the type of the array is not
`Copy` (with [RFC 2203]).

[RFC 2203]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2203

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) -> &i32 {
    const ZERO: &'static i32 = &0;
    if *x < 0 { ZERO } else { x }
}


fn foo() -> &u32 {
    const RANGE: Range<i32> = 0..5; // `Range` is not `Copy`
    let three_ranges = [RANGE; 3];
}
```

Writing out a `const` declaration everytime we need a long-lived reference or
a non-`Copy` array initializer can be annoying. To improve the situation,
[RFC 1414] introduced rvalue static promotion to extend lifetimes, and
[RFC 2203] extended the concept of promotion to array initializers.
As a result, the previous example can be written more concisely.

[RFC 1414]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2203

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) -> &i32 {
    if *x < 0 { &0 } else { x }
}

fn foo() -> &u32 {
    let three_ranges = [0..5; 3];
}
```

However, the fact that we are executing the array initializer or expression
after the `&` at compile-time is not obvious to the user. To avoid violating
their assumptions, we are very careful to promote only in cases where the user
cannot possibly tell that their code is not executing at runtime. This means a
[long list of rules][prom-rules] for determining the promotability of expressions, and it
means expressions that call a `const fn` or that result in a type with a `Drop`
impl need to use a named `const` declaration.

[prom-rules]: https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval/blob/master/promotion.md#promotability

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

This proposal is a middle ground, which is less verbose than named constants but
more obvious and expressive than promotion.

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) -> &i32 {
  if *x < 0 { const { &4i32.pow(4) } } else { x }
}

fn foo() -> &u32 {
    let three_ranges = [const { (0..=5).into_inner() }; 3];
}
```

With this extension to the language, users can ensure that their code executes
at compile-time without needing to declare a separate `const` item that is only
used once.

## Patterns

Patterns are another context that require a named `const` when using complex
expressions.  Unlike in the expression context, where promotion is sometimes
applicable, there is no other choice here.

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) {
    const CUBE: i32 = 3.pow(3);
    match x {
        CUBE => println!("three cubed"),
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

If that `const` is only used inside a single pattern, writing the code using an
inline `const` block makes it easier to scan.

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) {
    match x {
        const { 3.pow(3) } => println!("three cubed"),
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

In both the expression and pattern context, an inline `const` behaves exactly
as if the user had declared a uniquely identified `const` with the block's
contents as its initializer. For example, in expression context, writing
`const { ... }` is equivalent to writing:

```rust
{ const UNIQUE_IDENT: Ty = ...; UNIQUE_IDENT }
```

where `Ty` is inferred from the expression inside the braces.

An inline `const` is eligible for promotion in an implicit context (just like a
named `const`), so the following are all guaranteed to work:

```rust
let x: &'static i32 = &const { 4i32.pow(4) };
let x: &'static i32 = const { &4i32.pow(4) };

// If RFC 2203 is stabilized
let v = [const { Vec::new() }; 3];
let v = const { [Vec::new(); 3] };
```

I don't have strong feelings about which version should be preferred.
**@RalfJung** points out that `&const { 4 + 2 }` is more readable than `const {
&(4 + 2) }`.

Note that it may be possible for RFC 2203 to use the explicit rules for
promotability when `T: !Copy`. In this case, the last part of the example above
could simply be written as `[Vec::new(); 3]`.

Inline `const`s are allowed within `const` and `static` initializers, just as we
currently allow nested `const` declarations. Whether to lint against inline
`const` expressions inside a `const` or `static` is also an open question.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

This excludes other uses of the `const` keyword in expressions and patterns.
I'm not aware of any other proposals that would take advantage of this.

This would also be the first use of type inference for const initializers. I'm
not aware of any technical issues that would arise from this, but perhaps I'm
overlooking something?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

The main alternative is the status quo. Maintaining it will likely result in
promotion being used for more contexts. The lang-team decided to [explore this
approach](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70042#issuecomment-612221597)
instead.

It would also possible to separate out the parts of this RFC relating to patterns
so that they can be decided upon seperately. I think they are similar enough
that they are best considered as a unit, however.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Zig has the `comptime` keyword that [works similarly][zig] when it appears
before a block.

I'm not aware of equivalents in other languages.

AFAIK, this was [first proposed] by @scottmcm.

# Unresolved questions

## Generic Parameters

Named constants defined inside a function cannot use generic parameters that
are in scope within that function.

```rust
fn foo<T>() {
    const SIZE: usize = { std::mem::size_of::<T>() }; // ERROR
}
```

If we use the same rule for inline constants, there would be a class of
implicitly promotable expressions (e.g. `std::ptr::null::<T>()`, `T::CONST +
T::ANOTHER_CONST`), that could not be written inside an inline constant. We
would need to resolve this somehow before we stop promoting these expressions
as discussed in [future possibilites].

Alternatively, we could allow inline constants to refer to generic parameters.
Associated constants already behave this way, so I think this is possible.
However, it may result in more post-monomorphization const-eval errors.

## Naming

I prefer the name inline `const`, since it signals that there is no difference
between a named `const` and an inline one.

@scottmcm prefers "`const` block", which is closer to the syntax and parallels
the current terminology of `async` block and `unsafe` block. It also avoids any
accidental conflation with the `#[inline]` attribute, which is unrelated.
Additionally, it doesn't extend nicely to the single-expression variant
discussed in [future possibilities].

@RalfJung prefers "anonymous `const`". @scottmcm mentioned in Zulip that this
could be confused with the `const _: () = ...;` syntax introduced in [RFC
2526]. The reference refers to these as "unnamed" constants.

[RFC 2526]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2526

## Lints

As mentioned in the reference-level specification, we need to decide whether we
want to lint against certain types of inline `const` expressions.

# Future possibilities
[future possibilities]: #future-possibilities

It would be possible to allow the syntax `const expr` for an inline `const` that
consists of a single expression. This is analagous to the single expression
variant of closures: `|| 42`. This is backwards compatible with the current proposal.

Eventually, I would like to try making any expression that could possibly panic
inelgible for implicit promotion. This includes *all* `const fn` calls as well
as all arithmetic expressions (e.g., `&(0u32 - 1)`), which currently work due
to [the way MIR is lowered][arith-assert]. Even though bitwise operators can
never panic, I would also stop promoting them to be consistent.  This would
have to be done at an edition boundary. We would only do promotion for
aggregates, literals, constants and combinations thereof (**@RalfJung** notes
that this is the subset of the language valid in patterns), and
`#[rustc_promotable]` would be ignored by later editions of the compiler.
