Due to its size and complexity, this RFC is being run through an
experimental process. The text of the RFC itself is not in this file
-- rather, it can be found at the
[non-lexical lifetimes repository][r]. Prior to merging, the final
version of the text will be added to this PR directly; until then,
hosting the RFC at the repository allows for us to track (using open
issues) important points of conversation and so forth. Feel free to
leave ordinary comments on the PR, or to open issues -- important
points will be elevated to issues for further discussion.
