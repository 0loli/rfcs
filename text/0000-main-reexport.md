# Summary

Allow a re-export of a function as entry point `main`.

# Motivation

Functions and re-exports of functions usually behave the same way, but they do
not for the program entry point `main`. This RFC aims to fix this inconsistency.

The above mentioned inconsistency means that e.g. you currently cannot use a
library's exported function as your main function.

Example:

    pub mod foo {
        pub fn bar() {
            println!("Hello world!");
        }
    }
    pub use foo::bar as main;

Example 2:

    extern crate main_functions;
    pub use main_functions::rmdir as main;

See also https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27640 for the corresponding
issue discussion.

# Detailed design

Use the symbol `main` at the top-level of a crate that is compiled as a program
(`--crate-type=bin`) â€“ instead of explicitly only accepting directly-defined
functions, also allow re-exports.

# Drawbacks

None.

# Alternatives

None.

# Unresolved questions
