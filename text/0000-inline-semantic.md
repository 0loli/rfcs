# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Enable accurate caller location reporting during panic in `{Option, Result}::{unwrap, expect}` with
the following changes:

1. Support the `#[inline(semantic)]` function attribute, which guarantees a function is inlined
    before reaching LLVM.
2. Adds lang-item consts which retrieves the caller's source location.

Example:

```rust
#![feature(inline_semantic, caller_location)]
use core::caller;

#[inline(semantic)]
fn unwrap(self) -> T {
    panic!("{}:{}:{}: oh no", caller::FILE, caller::LINE, caller::COLUMN);
}

let n: Option<u32> = None;
let m = n.unwrap();
```

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

It is well-known that the error message reported by `unwrap()` is useless.

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', /checkout/src/libcore/option.rs:335
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

There have been numerous discussions ([a], [b], [c]) that wants `unwrap()` and friends to provide
the better information to locate the panic. Previously, [RFC 1669] attempted to address this by
introducing the `unwrap!(x)` macro to the standard library, but it was closed since the `x.unwrap()`
convention is too entrenched.

This RFC tries to introduce line numbers into `unwrap()` without requiring users to adapt a new
idiom, i.e. the user should be able to see the precise location without changing any of the source
code.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

## Let's reimplement `unwrap()`

`unwrap()` and `expect()` are two methods on `Option` and `Result` that are commonly used when you
are *absolutely sure* they only contains a successful value and you want to extract it.

```rust
// 1.rs
use std::env::args;
fn main() {
    println!("args[1] = {}", args().nth(1).unwrap());
    println!("args[2] = {}", args().nth(2).unwrap());
    println!("args[3] = {}", args().nth(3).unwrap());
}
```

If the assumption is wrong, they will panic and tell you that an error is unexpected.

```text
$ ./1
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', 1.rs:4:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./1 arg1
args[1] = arg1
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', 1.rs:5:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./1 arg1 arg2
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', 1.rs:6:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./1 arg1 arg2 arg3
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
args[3] = arg3
```

Let's say you are unhappy with these built-in functions, e.g. you want to provide an alternative
error message:

```rust
// 2.rs
use std::env::args;
pub fn my_unwrap<T>(input: Option<T>) -> T {
    match input {
        Some(t) => t,
        None => panic!("nothing to see here, move along"),
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(1)));
    println!("args[2] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(2)));
    println!("args[3] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(3)));
}
```

This trivial implementation, however, will only report the panic happens inside `my_unwrap`. This is
pretty useless, since it is the caller of `my_unwrap` that have made the wrong assumption!

```text
$ ./2
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 2.rs:5:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./2 arg1
args[1] = arg1
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 2.rs:5:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./2 arg1 arg2
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 2.rs:5:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./2 arg1 arg2 arg3
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
args[3] = arg3
```

The trivial solution would be requiring user to provide `file!()`, `line!()` and `column!()`. A
slightly more ergonomic solution would be changing `my_unwrap` to a macro, thus these constants can
be automatically provided.

```rust
macro_rules! my_unwrap {
    ($input:expr) => {
        match $input {
            Some(t) => t,
            None => panic!("nothing to see at {}:{}:{}, move along", file!(), line!(), column!()),
        }
    }
}
println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap!(args().nth(1)));
//                                ^ tell user to add an `!`.
...
```

But what if you have already published the `my_unwrap` crate that has thousands of users, and you
want to maintain API stability? Before Rust 1.XX, the builtin `unwrap()` has the same problem!

## Semantic-inlining

The reason a `my_unwrap!` macro works is because it copy-and-paste the entire content of its macro
definition everytime it is used.

```rust
println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap!(args().nth(1)));
println!("args[2] = {}", my_unwrap!(args().nth(2)));
...

// is equivalent to:

println!("args[1] = {}", match args().nth(1) {
    Some(t) => t,
    None => panic!("nothing to see at {}:{}:{}, move along", file!(), line!(), column!()),
});
println!("args[2] = {}", match args().nth(2) {
    Some(t) => t,
    None => panic!("nothing to see at {}:{}:{}, move along", file!(), line!(), column!()),
});
...
```

What if we allow *normal functions* be able to copy-and-paste its content as well? This is called
**[inlining]**, which Rust and many other languages have supported this as an optimization step. If
the function is inlined, the compiler can also tell the inlined function the location it is inlined,
and thus able to report this to the user.

Rust allows developers to use the `#[inline]` attribute to *hint* the optimizer that a function
should be inlined. However, if we want the precise caller location, a hint is not enough, it needs
to be a requirement. Therefore, the `#[inline(semantic)]` attribute is introduced.

```rust
#![feature(inline_semantic)]

#[inline(semantic)] // <-- new
pub fn my_unwrap<T>(input: Option<T>) -> T {
    match input {
        Some(t) => t,
        None => panic!("nothing to see here, move along"),
    }
}

println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(1)));
println!("args[2] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(2)));

// almost equivalent to:

println!("args[1] = {}", match args().nth(1) {
    Some(t) => t,
    None => panic!("nothing to see here, move along"),
});
println!("args[2] = {}", match args().nth(2) {
    Some(t) => t,
    None => panic!("nothing to see here, move along"),
});
```

If you try this code above, you will find that the panic still occurs inside `my_unwrap`, not at the
caller's position. `#[inline(semantic)]` is still only a very-insistent inliner, so its behavior is
still like a normal function â€” the syntactic location of the `panic!` is still inside the `my_wrap`.
The Rust language provides a different way to obtain the caller location after the function is
inlined.

## Caller location

The core crate provides three magic constants `core::caller::{FILE, LINE, COLUMN}` which resolves to
the caller's location one the function is inlined.

```rust
#![feature(inline_semantic, caller_location)]

extern crate core;

#[inline_semantic]
pub fn get_caller_loc() -> (&'static str, u32) {
    (core::caller::FILE, core::caller::LINE)
}

assert_eq!(get_caller_loc(), (file!(), line!()));
assert_eq!(get_caller_loc(), (file!(), line!()));
assert_eq!(get_caller_loc(), (file!(), line!()));
```

There is also a `caller_location!()` macro to return all three information as a single tuple.

```rust
// 3.rs
#![feature(inline_semantic)]
use std::env::args;
#[inline(semantic)]  // <--
pub fn my_unwrap<T>(input: Option<T>) -> T {
    match input {
        Some(t) => t,
        None => panic!("nothing to see at {:?}, move along", caller_location!()), // <--
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(1)));
    println!("args[2] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(2)));
    println!("args[3] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(3)));
}
```

Now we do get the caller locations, but the location in `my_unwrap` is also shown, which looks very
strange.

```text
$ ./3
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see at ("3.rs", 12, 29), move along', 3.rs:8:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./3 arg1
args[1] = arg1
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see at ("3.rs", 13, 29), move along', 3.rs:8:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./3 arg1 arg2
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see at ("3.rs", 14, 29), move along', 3.rs:8:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./3 arg1 arg2 arg3
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
args[3] = arg3
```

There is a more specialized macro, `panic_at_source_location!`, which allows you to customize where
the panic occurs. Now we have truly reproduced how the built-in `unwrap()` is implemented.

```rust
// 4.rs
#![feature(inline_semantic)]
use std::env::args;
#[inline(semantic)]
pub fn my_unwrap<T>(input: Option<T>) -> T {
    match input {
        Some(t) => t,
        None => panic_at_source_location!(caller_location!(), "nothing to see here, move along"), // <--
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("args[1] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(1)));
    println!("args[2] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(2)));
    println!("args[3] = {}", my_unwrap(args().nth(3)));
}
```

```text
$ ./4
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 4.rs:12:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./4 arg1
args[1] = arg1
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 4.rs:13:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./4 arg1 arg2
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
thread 'main' panicked at 'nothing to see here, move along', 4.rs:14:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

$ ./4 arg1 arg2 arg3
args[1] = arg1
args[2] = arg2
args[3] = arg3
```

## Why do we use semantic-inlining

If you are learning Rust alongside other languages, you may wonder why Rust obtains the caller
information in such a strange way. There are two restrictions that forces us to adapt this solution:

1. Programmatic access to the stack backtrace is often used in interpreted or runtime-heavy
    languages like Python and Java. However, the stack backtrace is not suitable for systems
    languages like Rust, because optimization often collapses multiple levels of function calls, and
    in some embedded system the backtrace may even be unavailable.

2. Rust does not (yet) support default function arguments or function overloading, because it badly
    interferes with type inference. Therefore, solutions that uses default function arguments are
    also ruled out. Default-function-arguments-based solutions are often used in languages that does
    not perform inference higher than statement level, e.g. Swift and C#.

## Survey of panicking standard functions

Many standard functions may panic. These are divided into three categories, on whether they should
receive caller information despite the inlining cost associated with it.

(The list of functions is not exhaustive. Only those with a "Panics" section in the documentation
are included.)

1. **Must have.** These functions are designed to generate a panic, or used so often that indicating
    a panic happening from them often gives no useful information.

    | Function | Panic condition |
    |:---------|:----------------|
    | `Option::expect` | self is None |
    | `Option::unwrap` | self is None |
    | `Result::expect_err` | self is Ok |
    | `Result::expect` | self is Err |
    | `Result::unwrap_err` | self is Ok |
    | `Result::unwrap` | self is Err |
    | `[T]::index_mut` | range out of bounds |
    | `[T]::index` | range out of bounds |
    | `BTreeMap::index` | key not found |
    | `HashMap::index` | key not found |
    | `str::index_mut` | range out of bounds or off char boundary |
    | `str::index` | range out of bounds or off char boundary |
    | `VecDeque::index_mut` | index out of bounds |
    | `VecDeque::index` | index out of bounds |

2. **Nice to have.** These functions are not commonly used, or the panicking condition is pretty
    rare. Often the panic information contains enough clue to fix the error without backtrace.
    Inlining them would bloat the binary size without much benefit.

This RFC only advocates adding the `#[inline(semantic)]` attribute to the `unwrap` and `expect`
functions. The `index` and `index_mut` functions should also have it if possible, but currently
blocked by lack of post-monomorphized MIR pass.

## Semantic-inlining MIR pass

A new inline level `#[inline(semantic)]` is introduced. This is like `#[inline(always)]`, but is
guaranteed that inlining happens before LLVM kicks in. With this guarantee, Rust can maintain a
deterministic set of situation where an `#[inline(semantic)]` function can know the information of
its caller or compile-time call stack.

`#[inline(semantic)]` functions must not be recursive, as direct inlining is guaranteed as much as
possible, i.e. the following would be a compile-time error:

```rust
#[inline(semantic)]
fn factorial(x: u64) -> u64 {
    if x <= 1 {
        1
    } else {
        x * factorial(x - 1) //~ ERROR: `#[inline(semantic)]` function cannot call itself.
    }
}
```

Currently semantic-inlining is performed as a MIR pass. Since MIR pass are run *before*
monomorphization, `#[inline(semantic)]` currently **cannot** be used on trait items:

```rust
trait Trait {
    fn unwrap(&self);
}
impl Trait for u64 {
    #[inline(semantic)] //~ ERROR: `#[inline(semantic)]` is not supported for trait items yet.
    fn unwrap(&self) {}
}
```

To support trait items, the semantic-inlining pass must be run as post-monomorphized MIR pass (which
does not exist yet), or a custom LLVM inlining pass which can extract the caller's source location.
This prevents the `Index` trait from having `#[inline(semantic)]` yet.

We cannot hack the impl resolution method into pre-monomorphization MIR pass because of deeply
nested functions like

```rust
f1::<u32>();

fn f1<T: Trait>() { f2::<T>(); }
fn f2<T: Trait>() { f3::<T>(); }
fn f3<T: Trait>() { f4::<T>(); }
...
fn f100<T: Trait>() {
    T::unwrap(); // No one will know T is u32 before monomophization.
}
```

`rustc` already has a MIR inlining pass, which is disabled by default. The semantic-inlining pass
should be run before or concurrently with the MIR inlining pass. The semantic-inlining pass is
currently as a separate pass from the normal MIR inlining pass, so that they can become
post-monomorphized MIR passes independently. If the semantic-inlining pass is run after the normal
MIR inlining pass, the normal MIR inliner must treat `#[inline(semantic)]` as `#[inline(never)]`.

`#[inline(semantic)]` functions may stay uninlined. This happens when one takes the address of such
functions. This must be allowed due to backward compatibility. (If post-monomorphized MIR pass
exists, methods via trait objects would be another case of calling `#[inline(semantic)]` functions
without it being inline.)

```rust
let f: fn(Option<u32>) -> u32 = Option::unwrap;
let g: fn(Option<u32>) -> u32 = Option::unwrap;
assert!(f == g); // This must remain `true`.
f(None);
g(None); // The effect of these two calls must be the same.
```

## Caller location lang-item

Once a function is semantically-inlined, the content of the function will know the span about the
original call site, which can be used to derive the filename, line, column, mod-path, etc. We would
define the following lang items to retrieve these information:

```rust
pub mod caller {
    #[lang = "caller_file"]
    pub const FILE: &str = "<dynamic>";
    #[lang = "caller_line"]
    pub const LINE: u32 = 0;
    #[lang = "caller_file"]
    pub const COLUMN: u32 = 0;
}
```

After the semantic-inlining pass, these constants will be replaced by the corresponding call site
information:

```rust
#[inline(semantic)]
fn line() -> u32 { core::caller::LINE }
assert_eq!(3, line());
assert_eq!(4, line());
assert_eq!(5, line());
```

These constants only make sense when used directly inside an `#[inline(semantic)]` function. This
excludes closures and const/static items inside the function, since they are represented as separate
MIR items.

```rust
use core::caller::LINE;

const L: u32 = LINE; //~ ERROR: Cannot read caller location outside of `#[inline(semantic)]` function

#[inline(always)]
fn not_inline_semantic() -> u32 {
    LINE //~  ERROR: Cannot read caller location outside of `#[inline(semantic)]` function
}

#[inline(semantic)]
fn inline_semantic() -> u32 {
    const L: u32 = LINE; //~  ERROR: Cannot read caller location outside of `#[inline(semantic)]` function
    let closure = || LINE; //~  ERROR: Cannot read caller location outside of `#[inline(semantic)]` function
    LINE // (only this one is ok.)
}
```

Const-folding pass before the semantic-inliner must recognize these special constants and *not* fold
them.

These values are provided as `const` lang items to make MIR transformation as simple as possible.
They could be intrinsic functions, but it would mean changing the `Call` terminator in MIR into an
`Assign` statement followed by a `Goto`, which is a bit complex.

## Source-location-forwarding methods

`unwrap()`/`expect()` will become `#[inline(semantic)]`. However if they are called deep inside from
the standard library, the source location would still be useless. Therefore, this RFC also propose
the following new functions to allow caller information be forwarded:

```rust
pub macro caller_location() {
    &($crate::caller::FILE, $crate::caller::LINE, $crate::caller::COLUMN)
}

pub macro panic_at_source_location {
    ($location:expr) => { ... },
    ($location:expr, $fmt:expr) => { ... },
    ($location:expr, $fmt:expr, $($args:tt)*) => { ... },
}

impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32)) -> T;
    pub fn expect_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32), msg: &str) -> T;
}

impl<T, E> Result<T, E> {
    pub fn unwrap_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32)) -> T;
    pub fn expect_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32), msg: &str) -> T;
    pub fn unwrap_err_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32)) -> E;
    pub fn expect_err_at_source_location(self, location: &(&'static str, u32, u32), msg: &str) -> E;
}
```

Example:

```rust
impl<'a, K, Q, V> Index<&'a Q> for BTreeMap<K, V>
where
    K: Ord + Borrow<Q>,
    Q: Ord + ?Sized,
{
    type Output = V;

    #[inline(semantic)]
    fn index(&self, key: &Q) -> &V {
        self.get(key).expect_at_source_location(caller_location!(), "no entry found for key")
    }
}
```

Long names are given since they are considered advanced functions and should not be used normally.

## Runtime-free backtrace for `?` operator

The standard `Try` implementations could participate in specialization, so external crates like
`error_chain` could provide a specialized impl that prepends the caller location into the callstack
everytime `?` is used.

```rust
// libcore:
impl<T, E> Try for Result<T, E> {
    type Ok = T;
    type Error = E;

    fn into_result(self) -> Self { self }
    fn from_ok(v: Self::Ok) -> Self { Ok(v) }
    default fn from_error(e: Self::Error) -> Self { Err(e) }
//  ^~~~~~~
}

// my_crate:
impl<T> Try for Result<T, my_crate::error::Error> {
    #[inline(semantic)]
    fn from_error(mut e: Self::Error) -> Self {
        e.call_stack.push(*caller_location!());
        Err(e)
    }
}
```

## Code bloat

Previously, all call to `unwrap()` and `expect()` will refer to the same location. Therefore, the panicking branch will
only need to reuse a pointer to a single global tuple.

After this RFC is implemented, the panicking branch will need to allocate space to store the varying caller location,
so the number of instructions per `unwrap()`/`expect()` will increase.

Also the optimizer will lose the opportunity to consolidate all jumps to the panicking branch, e.g. with the code
`a.unwrap() + b.unwrap()`, before this RFC LLVM will optimize it to something like

```rust
if (a.tag != SOME || b.tag != SOME) {
    panic(&("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value", "src/libcore/option.rs", 335, 20));
}
a.value_of_some + b.value_of_some
```

After this RFC, LLVM can only lower this to

```rust
if (a.tag != SOME) {
    panic(&("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value", "1.rs", 1, 1));
}
if (b.tag != SOME) {
    panic(&("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value", "1.rs", 1, 14));
}
a.value_of_some + b.value_of_some
```

## Does not support dynamic call

`#[inline(semantic)]` relies on compile-time inlining to resolve the caller information. This makes it impossible to
work with dynamic function calls (i.e. via a function pointer or trait object v-table).

## Narrow solution scope

`#[inline(semantic)]` is only useful in solving the "get caller location" problem. Introducing an entirely new feature
just for this problem seems wasteful.

[Default function arguments](#default-function-arguments) is another possible solution for this problem but with much
wider application.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

## Rationale

This RFC tries to abide by the following restrictions:

1. **Precise caller location**. Standard library functions which commonly panics will report the
    source location at where the user call them. The source location should never point inside the
    standard library. Examples of these functions include `Option::unwrap` and `HashMap::index`.

2. **Source compatibility**. User should never need to modify existing source code to benefit from
    the improved precision.

3. **Debug-info independence**. The precise caller location can still be reported even after
    stripping of debug information, which is very common on released software.

4. **Interface independence**. The implementation of a trait should be able to decide whether to
    accept a the caller information. It shouldn't require the trait itself to enforce it, i.e. it
    should not affect the signature of the function. This is an extension of rule 2, since the
    `Index` trait is involved in `HashMap::index`. The stability of `Index` must be upheld, e.g. it
    should remain object-safe, and existing implementions should not be forced to accept the caller
    location.

Restriction 4 "interface independence" is currently not implemented due to lack of
post-monomorphized MIR pass, but `#[inline(semantic)]` itself as a language feature follows this
restriction.

## Alternatives

### ðŸš² Name of everything ðŸš²

* Is `#[inline(semantic)]` an accurate description? `#[inline(mir)]`? `#[inline(force)]`?
    `#[inline(with_caller_location)]`?
* Use a different attribute, instead of piggybacking on `#[inline]`?
* `***_at_source_location` is too long?
* Should we move `std::panic::Location` into `core`, and not use a 3-tuple to represent the
    location? Note that this is also advocated in [RFC 2070].
* Use intrinsics or static instead of consts for `core::caller::{FILE, LINE, COLUMN}`?

### Avoid introducing new public items

* We could change the meaning of `file!()`, `line!()` and `column!()` so they are only converted to
    real constants after semantic-inlining (a MIR pass) instead of early during macro expansion (an
    AST pass). Inside `#[inline(semantic)]` functions, these macros behave as this RFC's
    `core::caller::{FILE, LINE, COLUMN}`. This way, we don't need to introduce
    `panic_at_source_location!()`. The drawback is losing explicit control of whether we want to
    report the actual location or the caller's location.

* Same as above, but `file!()` etc are converted to a special literal kind, a kind that only the
    compiler can create.

* We could make `#[inline(always)]` mean the same as `#[inline(semantic)]` to avoid introducing a
    new inline level.

### Inline MIR

Introduced as [alternative to RFC 1669][inline_mir], instead of the `caller::{FILE, LINE, COLUMN}`
lang-items, we could provide a full-fledged inline MIR macro `mir!` similar to the inline assembler:

```rust
#[inline(semantic)]
fn unwrap(self) -> T {
    let file: &'static str;
    let line: u32;
    let column: u32;
    unsafe {
        mir! {
            StorageLive(file);
            file = const $CallerFile;
            StorageLive(line);
            line = const $CallerLine;
            StorageLive(column);
            column = const $CallerColumn;
            goto -> 'c;
        }
    }
    'c: {
        panic!("{}:{}:{}: oh no", file, line, column);
    }
}
```

The problem of `mir!` in this context is trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer. `mir!` is a very
generic mechanism, which requiring stabilizing the MIR syntax and considering the interaction with
the surrounding code. Besides, `#[inline(semantic)]` itself still exists and the magic constants
`$CallerFile` etc are still magic.

### Default function arguments

Assume this is solved by implementing [RFC issue 323].

```rust
fn unwrap(file: &'static str = file!(), line: u32 = line!(), column: u32 = column!()) -> T {
    panic!("{}:{}:{}: oh no", file, line, column);
}
```

Default arguments was a serious contender to the better-caller-location problem as this is usually
how other languages solve it.

| Language | Syntax |
|:---------|:-------|
| [Swift] | `func unwrap(file: String = #file, line: Int = #line) -> T` |
| [D] | `T unwrap(string file = __FILE__, size_t line = __LINE__)` |
| [C#] 5+ | `T Unwrap([CallerFilePath] string file = "<n/a>", [CallerLineNumber] int line = 0)` |
| [Haskell] with GHC | `unwrap :: (?callstack :: CallStack) => Maybe t -> t` |
| [C++] with GCC 4.8+ | `T unwrap(const char* file = __builtin_FILE(), int line = __builtin_LINE())` |

A naive solution will violate restriction 4 "interface independence": adding the `file, line, column`
arguments to `index()` will change its signature. This can be resolved if this is taken into
account.

```rust
impl<'a, K, Q, V> Index<&'a Q> for BTreeMap<K, V>
where
    K: Ord + Borrow<Q>,
    Q: Ord + ?Sized,
{
    type Output = V;

    // This should satisfy the trait even if the trait specifies
    // `fn index(&self, idx: Idx) -> &Self::Output`
    #[inline]
    fn index(&self, key: &Q, file: &'static str = file!(), line: u32 = line!(), column: u32 = column!()) -> &V {
        self.get(key).expect("no entry found for key", file, line, column)
    }
}
```

This can be resolved if the future default argument proposal takes this into account. But again,
this feature itself is going to be large and controversial.

## Non-viable alternatives

Many alternatives have been proposed before but failed to satisfy the restrictions laid out in the
[Rationale](#rationale) subsection, thus should *not* be considered viable alternatives within this
RFC.

### Macros

The `unwrap!()` macro introduced in [RFC 1669] allows the user to write `unwrap!(x)` instead of
`x.unwrap()`.

Similar solution is introducing a `loc!()` macro that expands to
`concat!(file!(), ":", line!(), ":", column!())`, so user writes `x.expect(loc!())` instead of
`x.unwrap()`.

There is even the [`better_unwrap` crate](https://github.com/abonander/better_unwraps) that
automatically rewrites all `unwrap()` and `expect()` inside a module to provide the caller location
through a procedural attribute.

All of these are non-viable, since they require the user to actively change their source code, thus
violating restriction 2 "source compatibility", ~~unless we are willing to drop the `!` from
macros~~.

(Also, all pre-typeck rewrites are prone to false-positive affecting unrelated types that have an
`unwrap()` method. Post-typeck rewrites are no different from this RFC.)

### Backtrace

When given debug information (DWARF section on Linux, `*.pdb` file on Windows, `*.dSYM` folder on
macOS), the program is able to obtain the source code location for each address. This solution is
often used in runtime-heavy languages like Python, Java and [Go].

For Rust, however:

* The debug information is usually not provided in release mode.
* Normal inlining will make the caller information inaccurate.
* Issues [24346]  (*Backtrace does not include file and line number on non-Linux platforms*) and
    [42295]  (*Slow backtrace on panic*) and are still not entirely fixed.
* Backtrace may be disabled in resource-constrained environment.

These drawbacks are the main reason why restriction 3 "debug-info independence" is added to the
motivation.

### `SourceContext` generic parameter

Introduced as an [alternative in RFC 1669][source_context], inspired by GHC's implicit parameter:

```rust
fn unwrap<C: SourceContext = CallerSourceContext>(self) -> T {
    panic!("{}: oh no", C::default());
}
```

The `CallerSourceContext` lang item will instruct the compiler to create a new type implementing
`SourceContext` whenever `unwrap()` is instantiated.

Unfortunately this violates restriction 4 "interface independence". This solution cannot apply to
`HashMap::index` as this will require a change of the method signature of `index()` which has been
stabilized. Methods applying this solution will also lose object-safety.
