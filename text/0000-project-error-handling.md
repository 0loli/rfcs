# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC establishes a new project group, under the libs team, to drive efforts to improve error handling in Rust.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The error handling project group aims to reduce confusion on how to structure error handling for users in the rust community. This will be accomplished by creating learning resources and pushing effort to upstream widely used crates into std. As a secondary goal this project group will also try to resolve some known issues with the Error trait and reporting errors in panics/termination.

# Charter

## Goals

### Agree on and define common error handling terminology

- Recoverable error: An error that can reasonably be expected to be encountered e.g. a missing file.
- Unrecoverable error: An error that cannot reasonably be expected to happen and which indicates a bug e.g. indexing out of bounds.
- Error Type: A type that represents a recoverable error. Error types can optionally implement the error trait so that it can be reported to the user or be converted into a trait object.
- Reporting Type: A type that can store all recoverable errors an application may need to propogate and print them as error reports.
    - Reporting types can represent the recoverable errors either via concrete types, likely paramaterized, or trait objects.
    - Reporting types often bundle context with errors when they are constructed, e.g. `Backtrace`.
    - Reporting types often provide helper functions for creating ad hoc errors whose only purpose is to be reported e.g. `anyhow::format_err!` or `eyre::WrapErr`.

### Come to a consensus on current best practices

Here is a tenative starting point, subject to change:

- Use `Result` and `Error` types for recoverable errors.
- Use `panic` for unrecoverable errors.
- Impl `Error` for error types that may need to be reported to a human or be composed with other errors.
- Use enums for types representing multiple failure cases that may need to be handled.
    - For libraries, oftentimes you want to support both reporting and handling so you impl `Error` on a possibly non-exhaustive enum.
- Error kind pattern for associating context with every enum variant without including the member in every enum variant.
- Convert to a reporting type when the error is no longer expected to be handled beyond reporting e.g. `anyhow::Error` or `eyre::Report` or when trait object + downcast error handling is preferable.
- Recommend `Box`ing concrete error types when stack size is an issue rather than `Box`ing and converting to `dyn Error`s.
- What is the consensus on handling `dyn Error`s? Should it be encouraged or discouraged? Should we look into making `Box<dyn Error...>` impl Error?


### Communicate current best practices

- Document the concensus.
- Communicate plan for future changes to error handling, and the libraries that future changes are being based off of.
- Produce learning resources related to current best practices.
    - New chapters in the book?

### Evaluate options for error reporting type aka better `Box<dyn Error>`

- Survey the current libraries in the ecosystem:
    - `anyhow`
    - `eyre`
- Evaluate value of features including:
    - Single word width on stack
    - Error wrapping with display types and with special downcast support.
    - report hook + configurable `dyn ReportHandler` type for custom report formats and content, similar to panic handler but for errors.
    - libcore compatibility.

### Consolidate ecosystem by merging best practice crates into std

- Provide a derive macro for `Error` in std.
- Stabilize the `Backtrace` type but possibly not `fn backtrace` on the Error trait.
    - Provide necessary API on `Backtrace` to support crates like `color-backtrace`.
- Move error to core .
    - Depends on generic member access.
    - Requires resolving downcast dependency on `Box` and blocking the stabilization of `fn backtrace`.
- Potentially stabilize an error Reporting type based on `anyhow` and `eyre` now that they're close to having identical feature sets.

### Add missing features

- Generic member access on the `Error` trait.
- `Error` return traces:
    - Depends on specialization and generic member access.
- Fix rough corners around reporting errors and `Termination`.

## Non Goals

- This group should not be involved in design discussions for the `Try` trait, `try` blocks, or `try` fns.

## Membership Requirements

- Group membership is open, any interested party can participate in discussions, repeat contributors will be added appropriate teams.

## Additional Questions

### What support do you need, and separately want, from the Rust organization?

I'm not sure, my main concern is getting prompt feedback on RFCs.

### Why should this be a project group over a community effort?

Error handling has historically been handled via community effort which has resulted a great deal of competing and outdated solutions and resources. An officially supported project group has the best chance of writing and maintaining up-to-date resources that would reach a wide audience.

### What do you expect the relationship to the team be?

The project group will create RFCs for various changes to the standard library and the team will review them via the standard RFC process.

### Who are the initial shepherds/leaders? (This is preferably 2â€“3 individuals, but not required.)

Jane Lusby, Andrew Gallant, and Sean Chen.

### Is your group long-running or temporary?

Temporary.

### If it is temporary, how long do you see it running for?

This depends pretty heavily on how quickly the RFCs move, anywhere between 6 months and 2 years I'd guess but don't quote me on this.

### If applicable, which other groups or teams do you expect to have close contact with?

Primarily the libs team, but there may be some small interactions with the lang team, compiler team, and traits working group.

### Where do you see your group needing help?

Primarily in drafting RFCs, writing is not this author's strong suit.
